# Revenue Trends in Cinema

This project explores a movie dataset to uncover patterns in the relationship between movie budgets, genres, runtimes, and box office success. Spoiler: It's not just about the star power.

## What’s Inside?

- **Budget vs. Earnings**: How does spending correlate with revenue?
- **Top Genres by Gross Revenue**: Which genres rake in the most money?
- **How Runtime Affects Earnings**: Does a shorter movie mean higher profits?

## Tech Used

- **Pandas**: For organizing and analyzing data.
- **NumPy**: To crunch the numbers.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: To make the data look good.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AvianshManyam/Revenue-Trends-in-Cinema

2. **Install the required libraries**:

Run the **revenue_analysis.ipynb** file to start the analysis  

# Key Insights
 
 1. **Bigger budgets can lead to bigger returns**: High budgets often correlate with higher earnings, but there’s no guarantee. Sometimes, smaller budgets (hello, indie films) can surprise everyone!

 2. **Action and comedy movies rake in the cash**: These genres tend to perform well at the box office. Romance... well, it depends if it has a superhero or not.

 3. **Runtime matters**: Too long, and audiences may get bored. Too short, and they feel like something’s missing. The key is finding that sweet spot.
